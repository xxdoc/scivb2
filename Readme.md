This control has been modified from its original. This build has
been termed as SCIVB_LITE and it further simplifies the interface
and use. The orginal project source is included as original.zip

This build is generally compatiable with code written for the 
original except for some rarely used features which have been
removed, or moved into the misc class. In several instances
method names have changed to better describe what it does.

The SciLexer.dll in this build has been updated to current build
3.3.9 and recompiled so that it is compatiable with operating systems
from Win2k forward. (no Encode/DecodePointer imports). 

The following lexers have been compiled in to this build: 

  asm vb vbscript sql cppnocase cpp hypertext xml phpscript

More highlighter files are available in the original.zip
